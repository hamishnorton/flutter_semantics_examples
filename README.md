# flutter_semantics_examples

Just a small collection of applying semantics to a flutter web application,
enabling users of screen readers the ability to use the site.

note: This is a work in progress.  It includes some of my working, which I hope is some what useful.

## Examples so far include

* Checkbox
* Live Region
* Show and Hide another input (Live Region)
* RadioButtons
